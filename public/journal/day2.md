# Day 2 – Into the Wild

> “Man only likes to count his troubles; he doesn't calculate his happiness.”

We left Baiona in the grey hush of morning, a soft mist blurring the edges of the world. The trail pulled us into the dense Galician hills—stone walls laced with moss, wildflowers pushing through the cracks. The climb was steady and slow, the kind that makes your breath shallow and your legs heavy. But it was quiet, and the quiet helped.

Halfway through, we stumbled across a waterfall—hidden, untamed, falling into a shallow basin. Without a word, we stepped beneath it and let the water pound the stiffness from our backs. It was freezing, cleansing, the kind of cold that jolts you back into your body. We stood there grinning like kids.

Five and a half hours in, we arrived in Vigo, legs aching but spirits full. We found pulpo cooked just right, tender with smoked paprika, and sardines grilled to the edge of crispness. Albariño wine, local and cold, washed everything down like it had been waiting just for us. Then a cervezeria—a dim, low-ceilinged place where the beer came fast and the conversations drifted around us like fog.

We’re in a hotel tonight. Our own room. Real beds. A shower that stays hot. It’s a  three-star hotel, but right now it feels like the Ritz. There’s a strange kind of luxury in exhaustion, in shared silence, in the knowledge that we earned this. Tomorrow, we’ll walk again. But tonight, we sleep deeply, exactly where we are.
