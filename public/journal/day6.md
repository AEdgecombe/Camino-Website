# Day 6 – The End

> “I felt that it was a misfortune that the essential things in life are so simple and obvious.”  
> – Jorge Luis Borges, *The Garden of Forking Paths*

We walked not to reach Santiago, but to become the ones who had walked there.  
The road was fiction. But our exhaustion — that was real.

It snuck up on us.

We’d done it. We had reached our destination. The cathedral loomed tall, and my eyes grew glossy. The world stood still for a moment.  

Bewilderment wasn’t the emotion I’d anticipated feeling, yet there I was, bewildered. I couldn’t make sense of the occasion. I was shell-shocked and dazed, likely overwhelmed by the glory of the day. Immersed in the splendour of Santiago, I was.

We headed to the Pilgrim's Office. Rows upon rows of clerks sat ready to stamp our passports and hand us the documents to verify the completion of our feat.

My number was called.

Stumbling through the true final steps of the journey, I was greeted by an older American woman behind the desk. We spoke candidly and easily — I often find Americans to be good at this. We joked and laughed, and I noticed I was spending more time at that desk than most others before me.

Amidst the conversation, she asked:

> “So, is there any particular reason for your Camino?”

I swallowed the familiar lump in my throat and answered plainly:

> “I'm raising money for Alzheimer’s Research UK. I have family who are affected.”

She nodded gently.

> “My brother has Alzheimer’s,” she replied.

Silence fell. The office around us kept moving, but we didn’t. No further words were spoken. It was a cathartic silence, the kind I’ll never forget. In that pause, we exchanged a look — a quiet understanding. One could have mistaken us for telepaths. She thanked me for my efforts. Her eyes were sodden, but an optimistic smile softened her face.

We said goodbye.

Except… It wasn’t just a goodbye. We had done something brilliant.

That smile — that quiet, grateful smile — was confirmation. Confirmation that we had raised £1,822. That this had mattered.

This feeling… This was what brought me here in the first place. This was the force that carried me through nearly 200km of hillsides, through bruises and blisters and silence and laughter.  

Something inside me had been lit. A fire, a call to action — something I had no choice but to follow. And now, having answered it, I understand: the Camino never ends. It just changes form. We carry it forward — in our feet, in our memories, in the quiet work that follows the walking.

It lives in the way we listen more carefully. In the way we let silence linger a moment longer. In the way we look at strangers and see something familiar.

The road taught us to endure, yes. But more than that, it taught us to feel — fully, openly, without apology.

And somewhere along the path, between the aching legs and the morning mist, we became the kind of people who would choose this again.

Not because it was easy. But because it was fucking real.

See you next time.
