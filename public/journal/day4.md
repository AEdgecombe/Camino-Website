# Day 4 – *The Light Between the Hills*

A shorter walk today, which we needed. Our legs were sore but manageable.

Breakfast was coffee and *pan con aceite y tomate*. We crossed the long bridge out of Pontevedra and kept a steady pace. The road was easier, less uphill, just quiet.

Stopped for lunch—*bocadillo de chorizo* and five pints between us. The barman laughed at us but poured them anyway.

Caldas de Reis is a small town, peaceful and slow. We’ll rest well here. Not much to say—just glad to stop moving for a while.
