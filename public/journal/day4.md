# Day 4 – *In The Valley*

A shorter walk today. A gift. 

Our legs were stiff, but still holding. The kind of ache that reminds you you’re alive. We started slow—coffee and *pan con aceite y tomate* for breakfast, simple and right. Then out of Pontevedra, across the long stone bridge, leaving the town behind in a morning haze.

The road flattened. The trees pulled back. For a while we just walked. No great hills, no suffering. Just quiet steps, conversation, birdsong, and the gravel underfoot.

We stopped halfway for a *bocadillo de chorizo*. The barman laughed when we ordered five pints each—*“Cinco?”* he said, shaking his head, but he poured them anyway. Cold beer and salty sausage. The kind of lunch that makes you forget you’ve walked four days already.

We reached Caldas de Reis in the afternoon. A quiet town, tucked low between green hills and slow rivers. Humble. Still. Not much happening, and that felt good.

Tonight we eat. We drink. We rest. And for the first time, it feels like we’ve earned a little stillness.
