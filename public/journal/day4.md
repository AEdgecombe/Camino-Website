A shorter walk today, which we both needed. Our legs were sore, but holding up.

Breakfast was coffee and pan con aceite y tomate, as usual. We crossed the long bridge out of Pontevedra and settled into a steady rhythm. The road was easier—flatter, quieter, less demanding.

We stopped for lunch along the way, then carried on through gentle woodland paths and small villages.

Caldas de Reis is peaceful. A slow, quiet town. We’ll rest here tonight. Nothing remarkable to report— just the calm satisfaction of stopping.
