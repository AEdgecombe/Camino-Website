# Day 1 – Planes, Trains and Automobiles

Day 1 draws to a close.

After a restless night in Santiago—punctuated by someone banging on doors and shouts of "mucho asshole!" aimed in their direction—we were up early to catch the bus to Vigo. There, we picked up our pilgrim passports and made our way to the Royal Monastery of Santa María de Oia. A few stamps later and the clink of a beer to mark the start, we set off on our four-hour hike from Oia to Baiona.

Our journey was soon interrupted by torrential rain, forcing us to take cover. Once it cleared, we climbed through the peaceful, green Galician hills. After what felt like an eternity, we finally arrived in Baiona—soaked, aching, but glad to have made it.

At the entrance to the old town, a man we spoke to mentioned there was beer, wine, and festivities happening nearby. With a warm smile, he stamped our passports and urged us to check it out. We promised we would and went on to enjoy the town that night.
