    content: `
It begins.

We left Oía just after sunrise, boots crunching on gravel, sea wind at our backs. The path hugs the coast before pushing inland.

- Saw our first yellow arrow.
- Talked to a German pilgrim who's walked this 3 times.

> “The way will teach you.”

Looking forward to tomorrow.
