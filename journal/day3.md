# Day 3 – *The Road*

> “The first and greatest victory is to conquer yourself.”

This was the hardest day yet. We left Vigo early and climbed all day. Over 700m of elevation, winding Galician hills that didn’t seem to stop. It broke us a bit.

Stopped for lunch in Redondela—stout and food to keep going. We sat on a hillside later with views like something out of a film. Our legs were wrecked, feet blistered, but we had to keep moving. No other option.

We arrived into Pontevedra drained. A busker was playing *High and Dry* by Radiohead. We grabbed burgers and ended the day with drinks in a local bar. We earned that one.
