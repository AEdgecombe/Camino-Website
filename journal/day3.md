# Day 3 – *The Road*

Day 3 was a big one.

We left Vigo early, already sore from the days before. The path ahead stretched further than I wanted to comprehend. I'm not entirely sure how I even made it to Redondela—that was less than halfway.

We stopped there, half-broken, and I filled myself with stout. O’Hara’s. Heavy and dark. Just enough to get moving again. We pushed on, no choice in the matter. The hills rose harder this time. Galician climbs that don’t seem to end, winding roads that make you question your decision to walk at all.

But the views came with it. Wild, vast, like something out of *Lord of the Rings*. Josh and I sat on a hillside at one point, wrecked but alive, watching the world stretch out beneath us. For a second it felt worth it.

Shins splintered, lips dry, feet blistered. We were dehydrated and nearly defeated—but not quite. We marched on. Not because we felt strong, but because stopping wasn’t an option. We’re doing this for a reason, and that has to mean something.

We rolled into Pontevedra as the light faded, and a busker was playing *High and Dry* by Radiohead on the edge of town. It hit just right. We grabbed a burger and found a local bar that had been recommended to us along the way.

It was a night well earned. One that tasted better because of the suffering.
