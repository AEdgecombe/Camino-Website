# Day 5 – *Still Walking*

We left Caldas de Reis under grey skies. The road was gentle to start but grew harder as the day went on.

The path was mostly quiet. More forest, small villages. We didn’t talk much—just walked. Everything is sore now. Legs, feet, back. But we’re used to it.

Stopped for food along the way. Some locals waved us through with smiles. It helped.

Padron is a beautiful little town. We crossed a river and knew we were close. We’re nearly there now. One more day to go.
