# The Journey Hasn't Begun Yet

> “A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.”

The Camino hasn't started yet — but it will soon.  
Check back here each day to follow the trail, the thoughts, and the stories as they unfold from Oía to Santiago.

Heads up, I'll be uploading content every evening while on the Camino!
